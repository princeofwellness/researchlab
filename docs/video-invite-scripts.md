## OPTION 1: "The Honest One"

> Look, I'm not going to pretend AI is going to take your job tomorrow.
> 
> But something did change. And most people haven't caught up yet.
> 
> For the past four months, we've been giving away free toolkits. Thousands of people used them. 
> 
> Now we're doing something different.
> 
> February 26th. One room. 40 people. Three hours.
> 
> Me, Roland, Ján — everything we've learned building with AI daily. No theory. No hype. Just what actually works.
> 
> It's called THE SHIFT.
> 
> 40 seats. Link's in bio.

**Time:** ~45 sec  
**Tone:** Calm confidence. No urgency tricks.

## OPTION 2: "The Direct One"

> Three questions.
> 
> Do you use AI? Probably.
> 
> Do you feel like you're getting everything out of it? Probably not.
> 
> Do you have three hours on February 26th?
> 
> That's it. That's the pitch.
> 
> 40 people. One room. Three of us who build with this stuff every day.
> 
> We're calling it THE SHIFT.
> 
> Not a course. Not a webinar. Just clarity on what changed and how to use it.
> 
> Link's below. 40 seats.

**Time:** ~35 sec  
**Tone:** Punchy. No wasted words.

## OPTION 3: "The Real Talk One"

> I've been making AI toolkits for four months now.
> 
> Free. Every month. Thousands of downloads.
> 
> And the question I keep getting is: "This is great, but... can you just show me how YOU use it?"
> 
> So that's what we're doing.
> 
> February 26th. Me, Roland, Ján. Three hours. 40 people in a room.
> 
> Roland on taste — what separates good from forgettable.
> Ján on leverage — what one person can build now.
> Me on clarity — how to think when everything moves.
> 
> No slides. No theory. Just how we actually work.
> 
> It's called THE SHIFT. Link's in bio.

**Time:** ~50 sec  
**Tone:** Personal. Origin story energy.

## FILMING NOTES

- **Location:** Doesn't matter. Office, home, outside. Authentic > pretty.
- **Lighting:** Face the window. Natural light. No ring light plastic look.
- **Camera:** Phone is fine. Eye level. Vertical for stories/reels, horizontal for LinkedIn.
- **Audio:** Quiet room. No music. Your voice only.
- **Edit:** Minimal. Jump cuts okay. Don't over-polish.
- **CTA:** Always end with "40 seats" + "link in bio/below"

## WHAT ROLAND & JÁN DO

They don't make invite videos. They:

1. **Reshare Roman's video** with a short comment:
   - Roland: "This is going to be fun. See you there."
   - Ján: "Been building toward this for months. 40 seats."

2. **Keep posting their own content** (show work, not promotion):
   - Roland: Process videos, creative work
   - Ján: Technical builds, frameworks

3. **DM their warm leads personally** — not mass message, actual personal reach-out

## POST-VIDEO SEQUENCE

Once Roman posts the invite:

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Day 1 | Roman posts video |
| Day 1 | Roland & Ján reshare with comment |
| Day 2 | Email blast to list |
| Day 3 | Roland posts unrelated value content (keeps feed alive) |
| Day 4 | Ján posts unrelated value content |
| Day 5 | Roman: "X seats left" story update |

Don't flood. One invite. Then prove value. Then urgency later.
